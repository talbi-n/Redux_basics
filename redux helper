what is redux :
  -layer on top of react
  - helps with state management (data in app and UI state )
Why redux : 
  - central data store of app
  - all component can access data from it 
  -makes state management easy 




exemple : 
 1-without redux :
                
                         app.js 
                         
          Blog                        HomePage
             
 lates blogs  comments             SideBar   Maincontent   
 NB : Blog and Sidebar component can access to redux data center
 2-with redux :
                                  app.js 
                         
          Blog  ------->   |Redux a central data store|             HomePage
             
 lates blogs  comments                                |-------- SideBar   Maincontent 
 
 


 get access to data : 
   1- If we have changes component subscrib in Redux the changes 
   2- redux return data as props
 make changes :
  1- component dispatch actions  with optional payload (data)
  2- action passed to reducers
  3- reducer update the central state
